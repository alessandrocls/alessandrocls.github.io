<h2>
Humpty
</h2>
<p> There once lived an egg named Humpty Dumpty. He was no ordinary egg, he had arms and legs when other eggs had none. 
He was very mischevous and liked to steal food. One day, while on his mischief trail, his nose caught the smell of Grandma Betsy's pie. 
Like a switch, his kleptomaniac tendencies surfaced. His head stooped low, his feet sneaking one foot in front of the other. Slowly but surely,
the pie was within his reach. Just as he was about to have the world famous pie in his hands, Grandma's dog saw him and started barking. This alerted a nearby
patrolling policeman. Humpty knew that he was in trouble, so he started running.

<h2>
The Fall
</h2>
<p> The two engaged in a long game of cat and mouse until finally Humpty was cornered. The policeman blew his whistle and strongly suggested that Humpty turn himself in.
However, Humpty was relentless. He climbed the tall wall in front of him to try to escape. As he reached the top he realized that the wall was too tall and he couldn't possibly jump down without harming himself.
Out of options, Humpty desperately told the officer to cease the pursuit or he will jump. Realizing that Humpty might harm himself, the police officer approached the wall and tried to lend a hand. However, his sudden
movement made Humpty slip and down he fell.

<h2>
The Aftermath
</h2>
<p>
When Humpty woke up in the hospital, he found that his legs were now attached to his shoulders and his nose was on his forehead. The doctor told him that he was no longer an egg, he was now a vegetable.
Humpty Dumpty spent the rest of his days on a wheelchair regretting his mischievous ways. And thus ends our tale of Humpty Dumpty and his fall.
