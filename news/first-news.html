Bob Rhombus, 74, a citizen of the UK, caused a commotion in his quiet town of Bedford when he claims that his pet goldfish can talk.

<p>
Bob Rhombus claimed that while he was having his afternoon tea, his goldfish started talking. "At first I didn't know what was going on, I was alone having my afternoon tea when I heard someone say 'ayy lmao'. I was pretty sure it was one of those rascals trying to pull another one on me when I saw my fish waving at me."
He then told his neighbours that his goldfish just spoke to him, and after one chitchat too many the whole town had heard about his talking fish. Not soon after, people have reported that his front porch is always full of locals trying to see the miraculous fish do its wonders, yet none have seen it in action. Due to Bob's elusive demeanor, 
his fish have been subject to a fair amount of skepticism. Jason Momoa, fish enthusiast, said "In my 20 years of studying marine biology, I have learned one thing: fish can't speak. That man is in fact, a liar and people should stop wasting their time on this hoax." Of course, many disagree with the veteran fish expert's statement. Our favourite republican,
Tonald Drump, said "Yes, I believe Bob. Have you guys watched Finding Nemo? If fish can't speak then how did they make that movie?" Most recent reports have said that the old man claimed he was bored and the whole thing got blown out of proportion. Kids, don't forget to call your grandparents; Don't let them turn into the next Bob Rhombus.
