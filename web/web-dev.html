<h1>Web Development ideas?</h1>
<p>As I have said before, at this moment, I really have no idea what kind of website I would like to make.
I took this course to improve myself and be a more wholistic student. Of course, I do not intend to finish this course and then never having used the skills I have learned.
Therefore, I am keeping this page pretty much empty <b>for now</b>. Hopefully, during the course of my lessons in Hacktiv8 I may be able to finally have an idea of what sort of website or information
would I like to share with the rest of the world.<br>
Cheers!
